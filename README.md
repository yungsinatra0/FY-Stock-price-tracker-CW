# Stock price tracker
 
Simple Python script that uses [Yahoo_fin](http://theautomatic.net/yahoo_fin-documentation/) to scrape stock prices from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) at scheduled times using the [Schedule](https://pypi.org/project/schedule/) package. It was used for my coursework in the Macroeconomics module.
