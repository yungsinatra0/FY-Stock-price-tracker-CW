# Stock price tracker
 
Simple Python script that uses [Yahoo_fin](http://theautomatic.net/yahoo_fin-documentation/) to scrape stock prices from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) at scheduled times. It was used for my coursework in the Macroeconomics module.

# Prerequisites

Make sure you have Yahoo_fin and schedule installed and have the latest version of Python.
